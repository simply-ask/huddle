WHAT IS VOICE SETUP?
Voice setup helps our AI accurately identify who's speaking during the meeting. You'll need to:
1. Record a 10-15 second voice sample using your normal speaking voice
2. Provide your name and job title
3. Save your voice profile for future meetings

This takes less than 2 minutes and greatly improves meeting transcription accuracy!

IMPORTANT: This setup link will expire in {{ expires_days }} days for security purposes. Please complete your voice setup soon.

If you have any questions about voice setup or the meeting, please contact {{ host_name }} directly.

Thanks,
